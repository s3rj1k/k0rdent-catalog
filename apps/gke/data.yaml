  K0rdent seamlessly integrates with Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), enabling efficient management of GKE clusters alongside other environments through a centralized control plane. Here’s how k0rdent works with GKE:

  - GKE Cluster Integration: Connect and manage existing or newly created GKE clusters using k0rdent, with support for importing clusters and applying consistent management policies.
  - Declarative Configuration: Define GKE cluster configurations—such as regions, node pools, autoscaling, and Kubernetes versions—through infrastructure-as-code workflows.
  - Multi-Cluster Visibility: Monitor and control GKE clusters from the k0rdent platform alongside clusters from AWS, Azure, on-prem, or other clouds.
  - Enhanced Governance and Scaling: Apply policies, automate upgrades, and scale workloads across GKE clusters using k0rdent’s governance and automation features.
  - Secure Access and IAM: Leverage Google Cloud IAM and GKE’s built-in security features while applying k0rdent’s role-based access control (RBAC) and policy enforcement across environments.
