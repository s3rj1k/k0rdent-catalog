  Calico is a networking and security solution specifically designed for Kubernetes clusters,
  allowing containers and pods to communicate securely across the network by utilizing a layer-3 based routing
  approach, effectively managing network policies and providing robust security controls for cloud-native applications;
  essentially, it acts as a container network interface (CNI) plugin within Kubernetes to manage network connectivity between
  pods within a cluster.
